# Installtion
1) The SPM12 is required for basic functions and necessary preprocessing steps.  
   source: https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/  
2) Both SPM12 and our codes should be added into PATH on MATALB before running.
3) Basic file organization is needed under the pipeline described in the demo.
